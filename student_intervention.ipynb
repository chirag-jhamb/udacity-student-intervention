   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer: ** Since this is a classification problem, the most appropriate models are explained below. The general applications of each model would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Support Vector Machines*: Due to its capability of handling large dimensions, SVM model is known to be used for a lot of purposes including texture classification, E-learning <a href=\"http://www.clopinet.com/SVM.applications.html\">(Source)</a> etc. because these problems have alot of features to be classified.\n",
    "- *Decision tree classifier*: As the name suggets, decisions are made using a tree trained from the data provided. It is known to be used in game designing, for eg. chess moves can be classified into a tree and then the bot can make the move depending upon each turn played by the opponent.\n",
    "- *AdaBoost Classification*: Mostly famous for its application in problems such as face detection. Its computational speed to calculate the objects with little features makes it right for such purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models were chosen because in supervised learning, the classification on multiple features can be performed very well using these models. Taking into account their pros and cons, these models would be a perfect fit for this data-\n",
    " ### SVM-\n",
    " #### If the data are linearly separable, or in other words, can be separated completely into their groups by a dividing plane (called hyperplane), then our goal is to find the equation of the hyperplane that best divides the groups. It is memory efficient as it uses a subset of training points called support vectors. It is known to be effective in case of higher dimensions and even when number of dimensions is greater than number of samples. On the negative side, SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation \n",
    " \n",
    " ### Decision Trees-\n",
    " #### Decision tree learning algorithms generate decision trees from training data to approximate solutions to classification or regression problems. In the case of classification, trees are typically represented by a set of if-then rules culminating in a decision.  This model is very simple to understand and to interpret, it can also be visualised. It is able to handle both numerical and categorical data (for eg. our present dataset having a mixture of both) and it is able to handle multi-output problems. On the negative side, decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. Also, it is recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree, since decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### AdaBoost-\n",
    " #### The AdaBoost algorithm trains multiple weak classifiers on training data, and then combines those weak classifiers into a single boosted classifier. The combination is done through a weighted sum of the weak classifiers with weights dependent on the weak classifier accuracy. It supports both binary and multi-class classification (which is good for our present dataset). As the model iterates over data, samples that are difficult to predict receive ever-increasing influence, giving it an edge over other models. The shortcoming of the model is its scalability, caused by its sequential nature.\n",
    " \n",
    " ## Reasons for choosing these models for the given data-\n",
    " Given the models above and applications, let's look at the data-\n",
    " \n",
    " - There are binary classifiers such as gender, internet access etc. having just two possible responses which make up for a good decision tree. The if-then rules might classify the students perfectly and help in finding out the major causes of failure. (Thereby predicting which students will fail and which won't.)\n",
    " - The number of features (n_features) is 30, which can be considered a high number thus implying that there are many dimensions. The optimal model for classifying higher dimensions is SVM (as explained above).\n",
    " - There are binary classifiers like gender, internet access etc. and multi-class classifiers such as Mjob, Fjob, family size etc.. It is possible that weak classifiers might be indirectly (for some psychological reasons) affecting the student's performance and thus other models might miss it. For these two reasons, AdaBoost is the optimal model."

    "### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
